# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.



1. You may or may not need to install rails and bundle manually in vagrant.
Take a look at VagrantFile to see how to do that if things aren't working 
correctly

2. Vuex, vuetify, and vue router are already added

3. type "foreman start" after sshing into vagrant to run the project
